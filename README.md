# Statistical-Analysis-of-Tire-Performance-and-Pit-Strategy-in-Formula-1-Racing
Analyzes F1 tire compound performance (Soft, Medium, Hard) using lap time data. Evaluates trade-offs between grip and durability to model race strategy efficiency. Focuses on real-time impact of tire choices on lap performance, pit stop frequency, and overall race outcome.
1. Introduction
Formula 1 car racing is considered to be at the pinnacle of motor sport, characterized by high-speed competition, high-tech innovation, and tactical driving. Of all the many aspects of car racing under such stringent conditions, tire compounds represent an important variable that can end up greatly determining a team's performance over a event. Every tire compound, namely Soft, Medium, and Hard, has different qualities that dictate traction, longevity, and overall lap performance. It is pivotal that any team interested in optimizing their competitive approach and enhancing their chances of winning really understand these aspects.
A Formula 1 car's performance is not only determined by engine output and aerodynamic aspects but also to a great extent by tires. Softer tires, for instance, provide better traction, leading to faster lap times, but are prone to wear quickly, leading to an increased number of pit stops. Harder tires, on the other hand, have greater durability, albeit at the expense of slower lap speeds. This delicate dance between speed and longevity is central to racing strategy, which highlights a close study of tire performance.
2. Objectives
The main objectives of this work are stated as below. First, it aims to examine in-depth the effect of different tire compounds, namely Soft, Medium, and Hard, on both stability and consistency of lap times over segments of a race. Understanding this relationship is important since softer tires tend to offer better traction and faster lap times but soon degrade, which can lead to greater inconsistency in lap times and a higher chance of performance loss.
Secondly, we aim to discover optimal pit stop strategies tailored to different meteorological conditions. Meteorological conditions play a major role in determining the dynamics of a race, including tire wear, traction, and optimal times of performing a pit stop. By modelling possible pit stop times under different weather conditions, our study aims to identify patterns thereof that can be used for strategic purposes, such as optimal times for tire compound changes or altering driving habits.
3. Literature Review
The effect of tire compounds on competitive performance has been rigorously analysed in motorsport-related studies. Smith et al. (2019) showed that softer tire compounds lead to faster lap times, but this comes with increased wear and unpredictability. Jones and Lee (2021) carefully explored this trade-off further, highlighting that speed has to be weighed against durability in tire choice.
Academic study of pit stop strategies has also become an important field of study. Brown and Patel (2020) highlighted that weather conditions play an important aspect in planning stops, suggesting that poor weather could necessitate earlier or more often stops. Survival analysis methodologies, such as Kaplan-Meier estimators, have also been used efficiently to study stopping times and predict optimal stopping times (Garcia et al., 2018).
Time series decomposition methods have been applied in lap time series analyses to detect underlying patterns and periodic effects due to tire wear-out and track development (Wang & Chen, 2022). This study extends these concepts by using a varied range of sources of information together with a large suite of statistical methods to provide an all-encompassing view of tire performance and pit stop strategies.
